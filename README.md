# Rage Tracker — mood patterns PWA

Live app: https://rage-tracker.bishvili.workers.dev

## What works

Install from Safari > Share > Add to Home Screen. Mood check-ins, energy, tags and notes stay on your iPhone. Explore time-of-day, activities, sleep and calendar context correlations. This is observational, not medical advice.

## iOS integration

Safari PWAs cannot access HealthKit or EventKit directly. An Apple Shortcut can send selected metrics or calendar event fields to POST /api/ingest with Authorization: Bearer <per-device-token>. Enter the separately supplied private pairing code in the app first. The server stores SHA-256 hashes of bearer tokens, aggregated health metrics and calendar events in D1. Mood records are never sent to the server. Transport is HTTPS; Cloudflare data is not end-to-end encrypted.

## Structure

- index.html / styles.css / app.js: UI and analysis
- sw.js / manifest.webmanifest / icons: installable offline PWA
- worker/index.js: Cloudflare API and asset serving
- db/schema.sql: database creation
- wrangler.jsonc: bindings

## Hosting

Static files currently live in Cloudflare Workers KV with keys of the form asset:index.html, asset:app.js, etc. PNG assets are stored Base64 encoded; textual assets are UTF-8. The Worker binds KV as ASSETS and D1 as DB. To redeploy source changes, update KV assets and the Worker script. Adding files to GitHub alone will not update the running deployment until a CI workflow is configured. Do not commit the private pairing code or a device authorization token.

## Privacy

No ads or external analytics scripts. Backups are unencrypted JSON. Cloudflare stores only the fields sent through Shortcuts. If the PWA is removed or browser storage is cleared, local data can be lost. Apple Shortcut actions and automatic execution vary by iOS version. Calendar ICS timezone handling is approximate; verify imported event times.
