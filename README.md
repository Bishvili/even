# Rage Tracker — mood patterns PWA

Live app: https://rage-tracker.bishvili.workers.dev

## What works

Install from Safari > Share > Add to Home Screen. Mood check-ins, energy, tags and notes stay on your iPhone. Explore time-of-day, activities, sleep and calendar context correlations. This is observational, not medical advice.

## Calendar-linked mood insights (v1.2.0)

In **Settings → Load 28-day calendar demo**, the app creates 28 days of fictional health context, 112 mood check-ins, and 47 calendar events. Categories include meetings, focus blocks, workouts, social time, commutes, and rest. The sample deliberately illustrates lower mood around meetings and commutes and higher mood after exercise. Use **Refresh the calendar demo** to regenerate the newest scenario.

The **Insights** screen separates **My data** from **Demo scenario**. Switching views never mixes fictional and personal mood or calendar records; personal dashboard statistics and recent check-ins exclude demo records. Refreshing/removing demo records leaves non-demo mood check-ins, calendar entries, and health entries intact.

**Calendar context** offers two descriptive comparisons:

- **Before → after:** For each event, find the nearest mood check-in within 90 minutes **before the event starts** and the earliest check-in within 90 minutes **after it ends**. Report the average paired change by category, only after at least three matched events.
- **Near events vs other check-ins:** Mood check-ins during the event or within 90 minutes afterward compared with check-ins **not** near any calendar event, restricted to similar broad time-of-day groups. Show a category only with at least three observations in both groups.

These are exploratory **associations, not causal effects**. Overlapping events may share check-ins and missing check-ins can bias results. The demo illustrates analysis behavior rather than predicting anyone's actual mood. Keep personal calendar data and health records private.

## iOS integration

Safari PWAs cannot access HealthKit or EventKit directly. An Apple Shortcut can send selected metrics or calendar event fields to POST /api/ingest with Authorization: Bearer <per-device-token>. Enter the separately supplied private pairing code in the app first. The server stores SHA-256 hashes of bearer tokens, aggregated health metrics and calendar events in D1. Mood records are never sent to the server. Transport is HTTPS; Cloudflare data is not end-to-end encrypted.

## Structure

- index.html / styles.css / app.js: UI and analysis
- sw.js / manifest.webmanifest / icons: installable offline PWA
- worker/index.js: Cloudflare API and asset serving
- db/schema.sql: database creation
- wrangler.jsonc: bindings

## Hosting

Static files currently live in Cloudflare Workers KV with keys of the form asset:index.html, asset:app.js, etc. PNG assets are stored Base64 encoded; textual assets are UTF-8. The Worker binds KV as ASSETS and D1 as DB. To redeploy source changes, update KV assets and the Worker script. Adding files to GitHub alone will not update the running deployment until a CI workflow is configured. Do not commit the private pairing code or a device authorization token.

## Privacy

No ads or external analytics scripts. Backups are unencrypted JSON. Cloudflare stores only the fields sent through Shortcuts. If the PWA is removed or browser storage is cleared, local data can be lost. Apple Shortcut actions and automatic execution vary by iOS version. Calendar ICS timezone handling is approximate; verify imported event times.
